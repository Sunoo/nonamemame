<h1>Mame32 Overview &amp; History</h1>

<p style="margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 3.75pt">
Mame32 is an emulator.&nbsp; Simply put, it allows a PC to mimic the internal 
hardware of a large number of stand-alone arcade machines from 1975 to 2000.&nbsp; 
Combined with the original software from these arcade machines, Mame32 will 
display and play 
the games on a PC.&nbsp; The software thinks it’s still running on its 
original box.&nbsp; Mame32 is the GUI version of Mame, the M.ultiple A.rcade 
M.achine E.mulator.&nbsp; It has an attractive, 
elegant, graphical interface which allows the user to forego having to type 
command line parameters, although it can still be passed these arguments, for 
example. ‘Mame32.exe dkong -r 1024x768x32 -refresh 85 -effect sharp’. For many, 
it’s easier to click the icon of the game.</p>

<b>1997.02.05</b> - In the beginning, Italian programmer and preservationist, 
Nicola Salmoria, combined his individual game emulators into the DOS based 
multi-game emulator, Mame.&nbsp; It was released Feb. 05, 1997.&nbsp; Since the 
source was also released, numerous people contributed new drivers to add support 
for more and more games.&nbsp; The number of contributors grew into the hundreds 
and has continued to increase over the years.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 3.75pt">
<b>1997.08</b> - Mame32 was the first port of Mame to the Microsoft Windows 
platform.&nbsp; It originally came out in August of 1997, adding the GUI and a 
considerable amount of new code to transition to Win32.&nbsp; The original 
Mame32 was authored by Chris Kirmse and later integrated Michael Soderstrom's 
Win32 command-line port of Mame.&nbsp; Michael then coordinated, maintained the 
source, and produced the releases.&nbsp; Mike Haaland and John Hardy IV joined 
the project in late 1997.&nbsp; Mike would wholly revamp the user interface to 
its current state and continue collaborating on core development. John provided 
testing, WIP updates, artwork, and served as the external point of contact for 
the team.&nbsp; Mame32 
releases followed the Mame DOS releases by a few days to a few weeks over the next 
four years.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 3.75pt">
<b>2001.05.24</b> - With the inexorable phasing out of DOS, the authors of the 
DOS based Mame ported it to the Microsoft Windows platform as a command line 
application.&nbsp; Evolutionally similar to MameDOS, it is run by typing in arguments 
from a command prompt, and has no GUI. [many people try to double click it, 
which opens up the command line window briefly, then closes].&nbsp; Its original name 
was Mame[w], it is now known simply as Mame.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 3.75pt">
<b>2001.07.24</b> - Mame32 was re-positioned, with the familiar GUI grafted onto 
the new Mame Windows engine.&nbsp; Mame32 is currently maintained by Kirmse, 
Haaland, and Hardy and is now released by John IV shortly after Mame[w] on the <b>
