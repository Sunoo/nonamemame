No Name MAME Compiling Help
===========================

I made some modifications to the makefile which make building different versions
easier (especially the MAME32 version).

To compile for Windows:
	make OS=win

To compile for MS-DOS:
	make OS=dos

To compile MAME32 version:
	make OS=mame32

I will probably make further modifications in the future, and when I do, I'll
document them here.
