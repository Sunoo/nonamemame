No Name MAME Compiling Help
===========================

I made some modifications to the makefile which make building different versions
easier (especially the MAME32 version).

First, (obviosly) is the make command:  make

Second, select your operating system (default = Windows):
	Windows XP:  OS=xp
	MAME32 version:  OS=32
	MAME32 version for Windows XP:  OS=32xp

Third, select your CPU optimization (default = none):
	Athlon:  OPT=at
	K6:  OPT=k6
	Pentium Pro (I686):  OPT=pp
	Pentium 4: OPT=p4

Fourth, decide if you want debug enabled (default = disabled):
	Enabled:  DEBUG=1

So, for examble, to compile a MAME32 version for Windows XP optomized for
a Pentium 4 processor:  make OS=32xp OPT=p4

I will probably make further modifications in the future, and when I do, I'll
document them here.
