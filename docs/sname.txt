
 SNAME Was an idea when Nicola droped from the official MAME build
 Pong and all the gambling games.
 I don't remember who released SNAME first But after allmost a year
 i decided to update it since MonacoGP Mame Driver Released by A Great
 Mamedev Phil Stroffolino and becouse alot of people didn't want to add
 these games in every new mame release.
