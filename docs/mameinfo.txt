Mameinfo Source v0.74  DMAME / MAMEW / MAME32
=============================================


WHAT's NEW 
----------

* Update to 0.74. Correct src\usrintrf.c






HOW-TO-COMPILE
--------------

To compile the Mameinfo Source you must copy the files in \src
to your djgpp  or  mingw\mame\src directory.
For MAME32 you must also make the changes in history.c and m32util.c
(see MAME32-Changes.txt)

Test 'MAME STATISTICS' with games like '720' or 'Mr. Do'.

With 'GAME HISTORY' you list the History.dat informations


With 'MAME STATISTICS' you list the following MAME statistics informations:
- The number of supported games
- Arcade, Clones, NeoGeo, Playch10, DECO Cass and CVS games
- Vector and Raster
- Screen Orientation and Stereo
- Various game info 'flags'
- Games sorted by year and type
- Romfiles and sizes
- Typical romset sizes
- Hardware list: CPU, Sound and Input
- Monitor/Video ASPECT RATIO

MAME STATISTICS NOTES
---------------------

- GAMES(ALL) = ORIGINALS (+CLONES) + NEOGEO (+CLONES)
  GAMES(ALL) = RASTER (+CLONES) + VECTOR (+CLONES)
  GAMES(ALL) = HORIZONTAL (+CLONES) + VERTICAL (+CLONES)

- NEOGEO/Playch10/DECO CASS/CVS: If you compile the Mameinfo Source you must have the
  drivers in the directory mame\src\drivers\ to calc all these games, because the
  function that MAME STATISTICS use is ==>  if (!ci_strcmp (s, drivers[i]->source_file+12)).

- The CPU- and soundinterface (CPU + SNDINTRF) list only the hardware of original games,
  without clones or NeoGeo games. The sound subsystems is 4. The only game with 5 is
  'tmnt' (YM2151, 007232, uPD7759, Samples and Custom) and this is not listed.
  TOTAL means the number of all CPU or Sound hardware in the original games.

  Some CPU and Sound chips have longer names, like TMS9980A/TMS9981.
  MAME STATISTICS use shorter names:

  DECO16    =  DECO CPU16
  Jag. DSP  =  Jaguar DSP
  Jag. GPU  =  Jaguar GPU
  TMS9980A  =  TMS9980A/TMS9981

  Discrete  =  Discrete Components
  GA.CG-1V  =  GAELCO CG-1V
  GA.GAE1   =  GAELCO GAE1
  Sega 315  =  Sega 315-5560


- DUAL MONITOR are games with two or more monitors (VIDEO_DUAL_MONITOR).

- 24-BIT DISPLAY are games with a palette that has 6 or more bits per gun, and would
  therefore require a 24-bit display. This is entirely up to the OS dependant layer,
  the bitmap will still be 16-bit (VIDEO_NEEDS_6BITS_PER_GUN).

- HI/TRUE BITMAP are games that wants to use a hicolor or truecolor bitmap, e.g. for
  alpha blending (VIDEO_RGB_DIRECT).

- SHADOWS are games that automatically extend the palette creating a darker copy for
  shadows (VIDEO_HAS_SHADOWS). Games: TMNT, Asterix and GI Joe.

- HIGHLIGHTS are games that automatically extend the palette creating a brighter copy for
  highlights (VIDEO_HAS_HIGHLIGHTS). Games: all SEGA C/C2.

- RESOLUTIONS: Displays all graphic resolutions and the number of games without the Vector
  games. Because Vector games didn't have a graphic resolution.
