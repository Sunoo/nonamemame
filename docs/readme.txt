Overall No Name Info
--------------------

I. General Info
---------------
   No Name MAME is, I believe, a derivative work of MAME. It uses source code
   acquired from across the internet. It is the ultimate goal of No Name MAME
   to include the largest amount of features and support the largest amount
   of games possible.

II. Source Code Sources
-----------------------
   MAME 0.72u1 - Nicola Salmoria and The MAME Team
   SNAME 0.2 - BraiNKilleR, Rodimus Prime
   PacMAME 0.37b10 - bgr software
   MiSFiTMAME 01/05/03 - Rodimus, MASH, Jeff Coleburn, XzeriX, Tinker
   Extra Games Compile Mame Pack for Mame 0.71 - BraiNKilleR
   PatchMAME 0.63.1 - BraiNKilleR, Stephh, Twisty, Haze, MASH, BillK, others
   SirPoonga's hacks - SirPoonga
   MAME:Analog+ 72.1 - unknown


Appreciation Section
--------------------

I. MAME 0.72u1
--------------
   Clearly this entire project would not be possible if it weren't for Nicola
   Salmoria and The MAME Team. Their hard work and dedication had provided
   4083 of the games supported by No Name MAME. And, obviously, they are also
   responsible for the MAME core itself.

II. SNAME 0.2
-------------
   SNAME was released by BraiNKiller and Rodimus Prime. They got eight
   removed drivers to work with the MAME 0.37B15 source. At this point most
   of the SNAME drivers have been replaced by drivers from the Extra Games
   Compile Mame Pack in No Name MAME.

III. PacMAME 0.37b10
--------------------
   Although all of the PacMAME drivers were included in MiSFiTMAME, I still
   felt that it was necessary to thank the folks at bgr software for their
   code which is included in No Name MAME.

IV. MiSFiTMAME 01/05/03
-----------------------
   Rodimus, MASH, Jeff Coleburn, XzeriX, and Tinker are responsible for
   MiSFiTMAME. This version of MAME adds 407 new drivers, and all of them
   (with the exception of a few of the PacMAME drivers) have been included
   in No Name MAME.

V. Extra Games Compile Mame Pack for Mame 0.71
----------------------------------------------
   I'd also like to thank BraiNKilleR for putting out the Extra Games Compile
   Mame Pack. He fixed up ten drivers that were removed from previous
   versions of MAME so they will play nice with MAME 0.71.

VI. PatchMAME 0.63.1
--------------------
   Despite PatchMAME being missing from the change log, I am positive that I
   have used some code from it. I'll fix whatsnew.txt and this file if I ever
   figure out when it was added and what was added from it. Thanks anyways
   BraiNKilleR, Stephh, Twisty, Haze, MASH, BillK, and the rest.

VII. SirPoonga's hacks
----------------------
   SirPoonga is (obviously) responsible for this set of hacks. Most of these
   hacks add various ini files to MAME, that are only used when a game meets
   certain requirements. Others are to add the ability to skip various
   screens. Another adds "-artwork_filledges", I am unsure of what this does.
   The last hack adds the ability to remove the input options from the
   Tab menu.

VIII. MAME:Analog+ 72.1
-----------------------
   I am unsure of who to thank for MAME:Analog+ (I hunted through the source
   and the web, and I can't find a name), but they have added support for
   various analog inputs to various drivers. If anyone know who is
   responsible for this, please send me an e-mail.
